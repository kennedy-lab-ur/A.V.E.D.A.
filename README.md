# A.V.E.D.A.
User friendly computational chemistry application for assessment of reactions in the presence of optimally oriented electric fields

After downloading Aveda, one must navigate to the Program's super folder and run:
```chmod -R 777 Program```
to change permissions on the scripts.

To initate an A.V.E.D.A. instance, ensure both intermediate and transistion state .xyz files are in a folder with the *Program* folder and *start.sh*. A user must specify the following criteria in the start command for a successful run. As all information is crucial, if any of the parameters are missing A.V.E.D.A. will fail to run. A run may be started by running: ``` as``` in a terminal navigated to the folder containing the previously noted files.
