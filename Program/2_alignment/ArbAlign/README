This folder contains the following items:
1.1.  Code -  a folder containing the following items:
      ArbAlign-driver.py - a Python source code for the munkresRMSD script,
      ArbAlign.py - a Python source code for the munkresRMSD script,
      PrinCoords.py - a Python source code for calculating principal coordinates
      genTypes.csh – a shell script to use OpenBabel to convert a Cartesian (XYZ) file to a SYBYL Mol2 file formatted as a conventional XYZ file
      genConn.csh – a shell script to use OpenBabel to convert a Cartesian (XYZ) file to a NMA connectivity file formatted as a conventional XYZ file
      RMSD-Kabsch.py - a Python script for calculating RMSDs by Jimmy Charnley Kromann
            (jimmy@charnley.dk) and Lars Bratholm's script from
            https://github.com/charnley/rmsd - Accessed on Nov 10, 2015. Please see
            rmsd-script/LICENSE for usage rights.

1.2.  Usage of the Driver Script (ArbAlign-driver.py):
ArbAlign-driver.py is a Python driver script to run Kuhn-Munkres optimal RMSD matching
ArbAlign can be used either as a command line or web tool. The command line tool has a driver script
that can take in many options or resort to sensible defaults when necessary.
Usage: ArbAlign-driver.py 
   [-b/--by {l, t, c}] 
   [-n/--noHydrogens] 
   [-s/--simple] 
   filename_1.xyz filename_2.xyz


   -b {l,t,c},
   --by {l,t,c}

Match atoms by l-label, SYBYL t-type, or NMA connectivity (-c). 
The default is by atom label (-l)

   -s,
   --simple
Perform Kuhn-Munkres assignment reordering without axes swaps and reflections. 
The default is to perform axes swaps and reflections

   -n,
   --noHydrogens
Ignore hydrogens. 
The default is to include all atoms


If the pairs of structures pass a sanity test, the tool will align them optimally and provide the
following information.
•  The initial Kabsch RMSD,
•  The Kuhn-Munkres reorderings for each atom and the corresponding RMSDs, 
•  The final Kabsch RMSD after the application of the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, and 
•  The coordinates corresponding to the best alignment of the second structure with the first.
